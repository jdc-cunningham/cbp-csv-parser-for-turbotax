Okay my sleep pattern is still mega f'd just woke up

But I need to get this done today

I have to group the portfolios together, didn't think about that yesterday

and detect if transferring to/from portfolios and make sure it all balances out

6:09 PM

this is tough... my mind just feels overwhelmed

I could try charting... since that would show me where stuff goes up/down...

Still working on the grouping though

I have been procrastinating on this (and job searching/interviewing)

This has stopped me from completing my taxes since I need to track all these... this year I did at least 3000 trades... damn

I did consider another service despite the cost... but I don't have all portfolio API access... but the CBP account dump has every transaction, so that's what I'm parsing here

First I'm trying to visualize stuff... find where I hit 0 in 2021 and then start buying for FIFO that's used in 2022

So far my thought is to append columns by currency name, and then tally up the rows

I have to import each year, as separate objects in localStorage to work with if doing a SPA deal

4:39 PM

yeah like this

```
[
  'USD',  'BTC',  'ETH',
  'TRU',  'DNT',  'AMP',
  'LOOM', 'BLZ',  'SPELL',
  'XYO',  'ANKR', 'MDT'
]
```

man this lost money too I only put $500 in but yeah lost like 60% of it or something can't remember.

It's actually a good thing right now that I lost this since it will reduce the amount of tax I have to pay since I have no income right now

I lost between $3-4K in crypto (when BTC was in high $60K price and dropped to $20K)

Same for Astra damn... lost money there, ASTR lost at least 80% of it's value, was brutal

I'm still bagholding there but not sure if they'll be able to turn around since they've been under $0.50 for a couple months now

5:08 PM

I've also donated to a few places yearly so that'll help me with reducing what I owe in taxes

I owe because of freelancing for half a year... sucks I paid my W2 wages in advance I think highest option as a single person and I still owe taxes lol damn

5:15 PM

man this is tough... tracking where it went, keeping it all correct

I could try charting... to see where I stopped because I did get to a point where I didn't do anything with crypto for a bit

5:21 PM

I'm looking for general rules

- if the amount and balance rows are equal, means this portfolio/event had 0 balance starting out

5:51 PM

I'm not really being productive since I slept poorly but using `currency.js` seems to help with regard to rounding problems

the other issue is keeping track of where stuff goes in what portfolio and FIFO order of transactions

I'm reminded of what good code is when I work on my old code and I want to scream lmao.

Will I do it again (write fast code to get it done, but unmaintainable)
