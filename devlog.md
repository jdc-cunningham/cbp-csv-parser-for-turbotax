I have been procrastinating on this (and job searching/interviewing)

This has stopped me from completing my taxes since I need to track all these... this year I did at least 3000 trades... damn

I did consider another service despite the cost... but I don't have all portfolio API access... but the CBP account dump has every transaction, so that's what I'm parsing here

First I'm trying to visualize stuff... find where I hit 0 in 2021 and then start buying for FIFO that's used in 2022

So far my thought is to append columns by currency name, and then tally up the rows

I have to import each year, as separate objects in localStorage to work with if doing a SPA deal

yeah like this

```
[
  'USD',  'BTC',  'ETH',
  'TRU',  'DNT',  'AMP',
  'LOOM', 'BLZ',  'SPELL',
  'XYO',  'ANKR', 'MDT'
]
```

man this lost money too I only put $500 in but yeah lost like 60% of it or something can't remember.

It's actually a good thing right now that I lost this since it will reduce the amount of tax I have to pay since I have no income right now

I lost between $3-4K in crypto (when BTC was in high $60K price and dropped to $20K)

Same for Astra damn... lost money there, ASTR lost at least 80% of it's value, was brutal

I'm still bagholding there but not sure if they'll be able to turn around since they've been under $0.50 for a couple months now

5:08 PM

I've also donated to a few places yearly so that'll help me with reducing what I owe in taxes

I owe because of freelancing for half a year... sucks I paid my W2 wages in advance I think highest option as a single person and I still owe taxes lol damn

5:15 PM

man this is tough... tracking where it went, keeping it all correct

I could try charting... to see where I stopped because I did get to a point where I didn't do anything with crypto for a bit

5:21 PM

I'm looking for general rules

- if the amount and balance rows are equal, means this portfolio/event had 0 balance starting out

I'm reminded of what good code is when I work on my old code and I want to scream lmao.

Will I do it again (write fast code to get it done, but unmaintainable)
